# Images for README.md

This directory contains images used in the main README.md file.

The following images should be created and placed in this directory:

1. **system-architecture.png**: A diagram showing the layered architecture of the application, including Client Layer, API Layer (Controllers), Service Layer, Repository Layer, and Data Layer (MongoDB and Redis).

2. **authentication-flow.png**: A sequence diagram showing the authentication flow between Client, API Gateway, and Auth Service.

3. **websocket-flow.png**: A sequence diagram showing the WebSocket communication flow between Client, WebSocketService, and DocumentService.

These images are referenced in the main README.md file using Markdown image syntax:

```markdown
![System Architecture](docs/system-architecture.png)
![Authentication Flow](docs/authentication-flow.png)
![WebSocket Communication Flow](docs/websocket-flow.png)
```

To replace the ASCII diagrams in the README.md with these images, create the image files and then update the README.md file accordingly.
